# Enlight E2E

In this project I would like to share automated E2E tests that I have developed during one of internal projects at [Apptension](https://www.apptension.com/). The tests were written using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and JavaScript, in addition I used the [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) framework to handle login with Google as [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) has limitations when it comes to multi-domain support.
