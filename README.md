# Enlight E2E

In this project I would like to share automated E2E tests that I have developed during one of internal project at [Apptension](https://www.apptension.com/). The tests were written using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) / JavaScript, in addition I used the [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) framework to handle login via Google as Cypress has limitations in that area.
